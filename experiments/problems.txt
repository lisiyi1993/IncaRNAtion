1. Display of the resulting RNA profile is not clear. One should add index at the first line, for example p_A p_C p_G p_U which means probability of ACGU. And at the beginning of each following line, one should add which position is that line for.

2. For the option -s_gc <target_gc> <nb_samples>, the number of output samples does not match with the nb_samples input. For example, setting nb_samples to be 100 at the begging, e.g. -s_gc 0.5 100, may still result about 400 resulting sequence.

3. If option -s_gc is not given, what would be the default <target_gc> and <nb_samples>

4. what is stochasticly backtracked sequence? More specifically, what is the different between the output from -b and -s_gc

5. The explanation for the result from the option -gc_data <file_name> should be in more detail

6. The RNA profile output between the two incarnation versions (python3 and c++ version) are not consistent.

7. Results of sample_gc_target could be sorted based on the value from the right
