1. Display of the profile is not clear. One should add index at the first line, for example p_A p_C p_G p_U which means probability of ACGU. And at the each following line, one should add the which position is that line for. (Problem is solved in the current repository)
2. For the option -s_gc <target_gc> <nb_samples>, the number of output samples does not match with the nb_samples input. For example, setting nb_samples to be 100 at the begging, -s_gc 0.5 100, may result about 400 resulting sequence.
3. If option -s_gc is not given, what would be the default <target_gc> and <nb_samples>
4. what is stochasticly backtracked sequence?
5. The result of the option -gc_data <file_name> is not clear
